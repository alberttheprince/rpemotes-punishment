# rpemotes-punishment

Punish your players for using certain walk styles! A resource made to "punish" players who use certain rpemotes-reborn walk styles to gain a competitive advantage in servers where walk styles that give players more speed can be considered abusable.

Dependencies:
- [rpemotes-reborn](https://github.com/alberttheprince/rpemotes-reborn/)
- ox_lib (**optional** for performance and notifications)

**FAQ:**
1. Why is this seperate from rpemotes-reborn?

Many users of emote menus simply remove these walks or don't have to worry about players "abusing" certain walk styles. Not every FiveM server is a serious RP or competitive PvP arena shooter, some people don't actually care about run speed!

2. why not just remove these walk styles?

See the reasoning in the previous question, not every server or community cares about "abusing" walk styles or emotes. Rpemotes-reborn is easy to modify, so delete those walk styles if you want to. I always find it funny to bait people into using "abusable" mechanics and watching them face the consequences. 

3. Why do I need ox_lib?

For notifications and cache.ped. By default, this is set up to be standalone. Just uncomment the ox_lib portions and comment out the standalone portions.

4. Uh, what's rpemotes reborn?

[A free to use emote menu for FiveM](https://github.com/alberttheprince/rpemotes-reborn/).
